# Educational Project

Hello everyone, recently I got interested in emulation topics, especially about x86 architecture, and I decided to start a project on fully functional x86-64 system emulator.

## How to use
The project is in unusable state right now.

### How to compile?
For compiling you need
- git (for cloning the submodule repos)
- CMake (latest version is good)
- decent C++ compiler (I used some new C++ features so C++17 standard should be supported
by the compiler)

Please note that I've been coding this on Windows 10 machine, so Linux build may not work.
